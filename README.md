## Getting Started with Python 3 in VS Code

1. Install Python 3 on your system if not already installed.

2. Open the project folder in VS Code.

3. Select the Python 3 interpreter (Recommended):

   - Open the Command Palette with ctrl + backtick
   - Search for and select **Python: Select Interpreter**
   - Choose the interpreter located in `.venv/bin/python` (if you created a virtual environment), or your system Python 3 interpreter.

4. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   Open the VS Code terminal and run:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate>
   ```

5. Install Python dependencies (psutil):
  Ensure there is a `requirements.txt` file inside `python-scripts/` with the necessary packages, like:
  Then install them with:
  ```bash```
  pip install -r python-scripts/requirements.txt
  Run your Python scripts inside the VS Code terminal:
 ``` python python-scripts/your-script.py```
